# AutomateYourJob
This is a small application built around the AutoHotKey scripts that I designed for work.

My eventual plan is to flesh it out by either superceding AutoHotKey, or creating templates
for emails & functions that AutoHotKey uses.

I intend to make this program modular and easy to edit the templates for the end user. More details
to follow when it's more fleshed out.
