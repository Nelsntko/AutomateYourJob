# AutomateYourJob
This is a small application built around the AutoHotKey scripts that I designed for work.

My eventual plan is to flesh it out by superseding AutoHotKey with robot.

I intend to make this program modular and easy to edit the templates for the end user.

The templates should be modifiable by a UI so the user can modify how each reference reads.

This is necessary so it can be written in different (natural) languages etc.
